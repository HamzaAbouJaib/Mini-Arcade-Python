# Mini-Arcade-Python
The Arcade Game Simulator is a Python-based application that allows users to play classic arcade games such as Snake and Pong in a modern, interactive environment. This simulator utilizes the Turtle module to create visually appealing graphics and animations while implementing object-oriented programming concepts for efficient and maintainable code. Currently the only games available are Snake and Pong but more games will be added in the future.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Arcade Game Simulator, you'll need to clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/HamzaAbouJaib/mini-arcade-python.git
```
Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the project directory and run the following command to launch the simulator:
```
python arcade.py
```
This will launch the application and bring up the game selection screen, where you can choose between Snake and Pong.

## How to Play
### Snake
To play Snake, use the w, a, s, d keys to move the snake around the screen, eating the apples that appear to grow longer. If the snake runs into the wall or its own body, the game is over.
### Pong
To play Pong, a two-player game, player 1 (Right paddle) uses the up and down arrow keys to move their paddle, while player 2 (Left Paddle) uses the w and s keys to move their paddle. The goal is to hit the ball back and forth and score points by getting the ball past the opponent's paddle. The first player to score 5 points wins the game.
